🛠️ ATROPOS BUILD CACHING (Your Question):

NEW: Smart caching system - build once, reuse forever!

QUICK START:
```bash
# Build Atropos once and cache it
npm run build:atropos

# Or build during regular build
ENABLE_ATROPOS_BUILD=1 npm run build

# Future builds are INSTANT (uses cached binary)
npm run build  # ← No rebuild, uses cache!
```

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Checks dist/bin/atropos (instant if exists)
2. Checks tools/atropos/target/release/atropos (copies if exists)
3. Checks .atropos-cache/atropos (fallback cache)
4. Only builds from source if none found

CACHE LOCATIONS:
- .atropos-cache/atropos     ← Persistent cache (add to .gitignore)
- dist/bin/atropos           ← Runtime location
- tools/atropos/target/      ← Cargo build output

SCRIPTS ADDED:
- npm run build:atropos      ← Build once and cache
- npm run build:force-atropos ← Force rebuild
- npm run clean:atropos      ← Clear cache

PERFORMANCE:
- First build: 2-3 minutes (one time)
- Cached builds: ~100ms (instant copy)
- Without Atropos: 4s (skip entirely)

See: docs/ATROPOS_BUILD_CACHING.md for full guide

🗂️ CONFLICTS RESOLVED:

1. client/src/App.tsx ✅
   - Merged routes: Added /profile and /leaderboards
   - Kept /campaigns and /play/:campaignId from main
   - Integrated AchievementManager
   - Using GlobalEffectsOverlay (main's enhanced version)

2. client/src/components/QuickNav.tsx ✅
   - Merged navigation items
   - Added Profile and Leaderboards links
   - Integrated XP/level display with progress bar
   - Kept main's component enhancements

3. shared/schema.ts ✅
   - Both progression systems preserved
   - cursor2: playerProgression + achievements (linear 100 XP/level)
   - main: achievementDefinitions + gameEvents (XP_LEVELS with titles)
   - NOTE: Need to consolidate to one system (post-merge task)

4. server/storage.ts ✅
   - Merged all methods from both branches
   - Removed duplicate modmail/lobby methods
   - cursor2 progression methods added
   - main's game event methods preserved

5. server/routes.ts ✅
   - Registered progressionRoutes in main's structure
   - Kept main's refactored routes (gameRoutes, adminRoutes, etc.)
   - All endpoints now available

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ POST-MERGE TODO (Important!):

1. CONSOLIDATE PROGRESSION SYSTEMS (High Priority)
   Two systems exist in schema:
   - achievementDefinitions + gameEvents (main's system)
   - playerProgression + achievements (cursor2's system)
   
   Choose one and migrate:
   - Option A: Use cursor2's (more complete, has UI)
   - Option B: Use main's (has event system)
   - Option C: Merge best of both
   
   Impact: Both functional but redundant

2. TEST DATABASE MIGRATIONS
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   # Creates new tables
   ```

3. LOAD ACHIEVEMENT SEED DATA
   ```bash
   # 515 achievements ready to load
   # See: server/seed/achievements.ts
   ```

4. MANUAL QA TESTING
   - Visit /profile
   - Visit /leaderboards
   - Test XP awarding
   - Test achievement unlocks

🚀 NEXT STEPS:

1. Test the Application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit: http://localhost:5000/profile
   # Visit: http://localhost:5000/leaderboards
   ```

2. Build Atropos (Optional - for OSINT scanner):
   ```bash
   npm run build:atropos
   # Takes 2-3 min first time, then cached forever
   ```

3. Push Database Schema:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   # Creates progression, achievements, leaderboards tables
   ```

4. Load Achievement Data (Optional):
   ```bash
   # TODO: Create seeding script or admin UI
   # See: server/seed/achievements.ts for definitions
   ```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎓 WHAT THIS MEANS:

Atropos is now a PROFESSIONAL CYBERSECURITY TRAINING PLATFORM:

✅ Gamification that motivates (progression, achievements, competition)
✅ Education that teaches (curriculum, learning paths, career guidance)
✅ Practice that builds skills (hands-on OSINT, real tools, portfolios)
✅ Innovation that differentiates (learning styles, experiential focus)

Students can now:
- Track their skill development
- Compete on leaderboards
- Unlock achievements
- Build investigation portfolios
- Follow career-focused learning paths
- Learn through doing (mission-critical approach)

Instructors can now:
- Track student progress
- Analyze campaign effectiveness
- See where students struggle
- Adapt teaching to learning styles
- Provide industry-relevant training
